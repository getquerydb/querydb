#### Docker
QueryDB is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
docker build -t querydb/querydb:${package.json.version} .
```
#### Spring cloud
Add the following dependency to your pom.xml after you have build this project locally.
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.querydb</groupId>
	<artifactId>querydb-app</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Create the QueryDB with only one single Annotation.
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableQueryDB
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}
}
```
